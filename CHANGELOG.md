- Added "If you answered YES/NO to #4" conditional guidance
- Shows appropriate project name prompts for both existing and new projects

### Background
- Users were confused about what happens after answering NO to "Link to different existing project?"
- The instructions now clearly show both scenarios:
  - YES: "What's the name of your existing project?"
  - NO: "What is your project name?" (for creating new project)
- This matches the actual Vercel CLI flow more accurately

## [1.4.25] - 2025-07-21

### Fixed
- Improved production URL detection with multiple fallback methods
- Tries to extract project name and construct standard Vercel URL
- Better handling of different Vercel URL formats

### Background

### Added
- Added npx cache clearing instructions to CLI help
- Added troubleshooting section to README
- Created comprehensive troubleshooting guide
- Documented `npx clear-npx-cache` solution prominently

- Clear documentation helps users resolve this common issue quickly

## [1.4.22] - 2025-07-21

### Fixed
- Fixed incorrect production URL display after deployment
- Deployment now shows the actual Vercel URL instead of truncated version

- The regex pattern was only capturing text before the first hyphen
- For `doc-builder-delta.vercel.app` it showed `doc.vercel.app`
- Now properly displays the full production URL returned by Vercel
- Also handles preview URLs with random suffixes correctly

## [1.4.21] - 2025-07-21

### Fixed
- Fixed hidden sidebar still taking up vertical space on mobile
- Made sidebar absolutely positioned on mobile to remove it from document flow
- Eliminated the gap that matched the collapsed menu height

### Background
- Sidebar was hidden with translateX but still occupied 250px in the flex column
- This created a gap exactly the height of the collapsed menu
- Now sidebar is position: absolute on mobile, completely removing it from layout

## [1.4.20] - 2025-07-21

### Fixed
- Properly fixed the persistent white gap at 768px breakpoint
- Resolved conflicting media query styles
- Kept breadcrumbs in fixed position on mobile

### Background
- Multiple 768px media queries were conflicting with each other
- Last media query was changing breadcrumbs to relative positioning
- This caused double spacing (margin + breadcrumb height)
- Now breadcrumbs remain fixed and margin-top properly accounts for both elements

## [1.4.19] - 2025-07-21

### Fixed
- Fixed large white gap appearing at 768px breakpoint
- Removed duplicate CSS definitions for breadcrumbs
- Corrected margin-top calculation for mobile layout

### Background

### Improved
- Enhanced tooltip extraction to show content from Overview/Summary sections
- Tooltips now display the actual overview text from documents
- Provides more meaningful previews when hovering over menu items

### Background
- Previously tooltips showed just the first few words from documents
- Now extracts content specifically from "Overview" or "Summary" sections
- Falls back to first paragraph if no Overview/Summary section exists
- Provides better context about what each document contains

## [1.4.16] - 2025-07-21

### Improved
- Enhanced menu tooltips to show clean text previews instead of raw markdown
- Tooltips now display properly formatted text with markdown syntax removed

- Improves user experience when hovering over menu items

## [1.4.15] - 2025-07-21

### Fixed
- Fixed index.html not being regenerated with current doc-builder version
- index.html is now always regenerated from README.html to ensure version consistency
- This prevents stale version numbers from being shown in deployed documentation

### Background
- Previously, index.html was preserved if it existed and looked valid
- This caused version numbers to be stuck at older versions
- Now ensures index.html always reflects the current build version

## [1.4.14] - 2025-07-21

### Fixed
- Fixed subdirectories not showing on initial page load
- Folders now expand by default when viewing index.html or root README
- Improved navigation visibility for better user experience

### Background

### Fixed
- Fixed h1 title alignment to extend full width above the navigation menu
- Added negative margins to h1 to counteract content padding
- Adjusted mobile styles to maintain proper alignment on smaller screens

### Background
- The h1 title was appearing offset from the left due to content area padding
- Now h1 elements extend to the full width of the content area for better visual hierarchy

## [1.4.10] - 2025-07-21

### Fixed
- Fixed mermaid diagram rendering by preventing HTML escaping of diagram content
- Implemented placeholder system to protect mermaid blocks from markdown parser interference
- Mermaid diagrams now render correctly without "Syntax error" messages

### Background
- Mermaid content was being HTML-escaped (e.g., `-->` became `--&gt;`)
- Markdown parser was breaking up mermaid blocks by interpreting indented lines as code blocks
- Fixed by processing mermaid blocks before markdown parsing and using placeholders

## [1.4.9] - 2025-07-21

### Fixed
- Fixed sidebar resizing issue where menu overlapped content instead of pushing it
- Changed sidebar from `position: fixed` to `position: relative` to work properly with flexbox layout
- Added `flex-shrink: 0` to sidebar to prevent shrinking
- Removed unnecessary banner-specific positioning adjustments

### Background
- The sidebar was using fixed positioning which took it out of document flow
- This caused the resize handle to only change sidebar width without affecting content position
- With relative positioning and flexbox, the content now properly adjusts when sidebar is resized

## [1.4.8] - 2025-07-21

### Fixed
- Fixed excessive spacing between breadcrumbs and navigation menu
- Changed breadcrumb default positioning from `calc(var(--header-height) + 3.5rem)` to `var(--header-height)`
- Removed duplicate `.sidebar` and `.main-wrapper` CSS definitions causing layout conflicts

### Background
- The breadcrumb bar was incorrectly adding banner height (3.5rem) even when no banner was visible
- Duplicate CSS definitions for `.main-wrapper` were using conflicting spacing approaches (padding vs margin)
- This fixes the final spacing issue in the CSS cleanup series from v1.4.5-v1.4.7

## [1.4.7] - 2025-07-21

### Fixed
- Removed excess spacing above navigation menu by setting sidebar-header margin-bottom to 0
- Cleaned up duplicate `.sidebar-header` CSS definitions that were causing conflicts

### Background
- Previous CSS fixes exposed duplicate `.sidebar-header` definitions with conflicting margins
- The extra spacing was introduced by `margin-bottom: var(--space-4)` on the sidebar header
- This completes the CSS cleanup started in v1.4.5 and v1.4.6

## [1.4.6] - 2025-07-21

### Fixed
- Restored breadcrumb height from 0px to 40px to fix visibility issue
- Removed duplicate CSS rules that were causing filter icon overlap
- Cleaned up duplicate `.filter-box`, `.filter-icon`, and `.sidebar-breadcrumbs` definitions

### Background
- The removal of style.css in v1.4.5 exposed pre-existing CSS conflicts
- Duplicate CSS rules were causing the filter icon to render incorrectly
- Breadcrumb height of 0px (set in v1.3.2) made the breadcrumb bar invisible

## [1.4.5] - 2025-07-21

### Fixed
- Removed all references to non-existent style.css file
- Fixed CSS rendering issues where root page appeared different from other pages
- Updated CSS existence check in deploy.js to verify notion-style.css instead

### Background
- style.css was removed in v1.4.0 but code references remained
- This caused 404 errors and potential CSS loading failures
- All pages now correctly load only notion-style.css as intended

## [1.4.4] - 2025-07-21

### Added
- Added doc-builder version tooltip to "Last updated" text in header
- When hovering over the deployment date, users now see which version of doc-builder was used

## [1.4.2] - 2025-01-20

### Fixed
- Fixed excessive left padding on content area by removing JavaScript margin-left assignments
- Content layout now properly uses flexbox spacing without manual margin adjustments
- The JavaScript was adding inline `style="margin-left: 200px;"` which was causing the issue

### Fixed
- **Critical CSS layout fix** - Content no longer appears too far right when sidebar is hidden
- Removed incorrect `margin-left: var(--sidebar-width)` from `.content` class
- Fixed responsive layout issues where content had excessive right spacing
- Simplified responsive styles to match original working version

- Main wrapper uses margin-top approach (not absolute positioning)
- Content uses original padding values (var(--space-6) var(--space-8))
- Content-inner uses centered layout (margin: 0 auto)

### Removed
- Removed unused style.css file - only notion-style.css is used
- Eliminated dual CSS file confusion

### Technical Details

### Fixed
- Fixed excessive gap between breadcrumb and content area
- Changed `.main-wrapper` from using `margin-top` to `padding-top` to eliminate double spacing

- Added debug logging to help diagnose tooltip initialization issues
- Content structure matches original with proper content-inner wrapper

## [1.3.11] - 2025-07-19

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Removed duplicate CSS file loading that was causing style conflicts
- Now only loads `notion-style.css` matching the original working build
- This fixes both tooltip functionality and spacing issues

### Root Cause
- The npm package was loading both `notion-style.css` AND `style.css`
- The `style.css` file was overriding proper styles from `notion-style.css`
