## Style Guide

### JavaScript Style Guide

* Use ES6+ features where appropriate
* 2 spaces for indentation
* Use semicolons
* Use `const` and `let`, avoid `var`
* Use meaningful variable names
* Add comments for complex logic

### Documentation Style Guide

* Use Markdown for all documentation
* Include code examples where relevant
* Keep line length to 80 characters where possible
* Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")

## Testing

* Write tests for new features
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Aim for high code coverage
* Test edge cases
