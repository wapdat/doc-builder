### Title
Show HN: I built a documentation generator that deploys to Vercel in one command

### Post
I got tired of the complexity involved in creating good-looking documentation sites, so I built Doc Builder.

It's a simple tool that:
- Converts markdown to beautiful HTML (Notion-inspired design)
- Deploys to Vercel with zero configuration
- Includes search, dark mode, and syntax highlighting out of the box
- Supports Mermaid diagrams for visualizations

The entire flow is just:
```
npx @knowcode/doc-builder@latest init
npx @knowcode/doc-builder@latest deploy
```

I've been using it for all my projects and it's saved me hours of setup time. The output looks professional without any CSS tweaking.

Technical details:
- Built with Node.js
- Generates static HTML for performance
- SEO optimized with meta tags and structured data
- Optional password protection for private docs
- Automatic navigation generation from folder structure

Demo: https://doc-builder-delta.vercel.app
NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@knowcode/doc-builder

The code is MIT licensed. Would love feedback from the HN community!

No more hours of setup. No more ugly docs.

npx @knowcode/doc-builder@latest deploy

That's it. You're live on Vercel.

The problem: Every documentation tool is either:
- Too complex (hours to configure)
- Too simple (looks unprofessional)
- Requires separate deployment setup
- Costs too much for small projects

I needed something better.

‚ú® Notion-inspired design
üîç Full-text search built-in

Zero configuration needed. It just works.

5/7
The magic is in the simplicity:

1. Write markdown files
2. Run: npx @knowcode/doc-builder@latest init
3. Run: npx @knowcode/doc-builder@latest deploy
4. Your docs are live!

No build configs. No deployment scripts. No hassle.

6/7
Built this because I was tired of spending more time setting up docs than writing them.

Now I can focus on content, not configuration.

Check out the demo: doc-builder-delta.vercel.app

It's open source (MIT license) and available on npm today!

Would love your feedback. What features would make this even better for your documentation needs?

I Built a Documentation Generator That Deploys in One Command - Here's Why and How

### Tags

### Content
## The Problem That Started It All

Last month, I was starting my fifth project of the year, and once again, I found myself spending hours setting up documentation infrastructure. Configure this, install that, write deployment scripts, fix CSS issues... 

Sound familiar?

That's when I decided enough was enough. I needed a documentation tool that:
- Works out of the box
- Looks professional without customization
- Deploys with zero configuration
- Doesn't require a PhD in DevOps

## Enter Doc Builder

Doc Builder is a simple tool that transforms your markdown files into beautiful, searchable documentation sites. The entire setup and deployment process takes less than a minute.

### How It Works

1. **Install and Initialize**
```bash
npx @knowcode/doc-builder@latest init
```

This creates a simple structure:
```
your-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ doc-builder.config.js
```

2. **Write Your Docs**
Just create markdown files in the `docs` folder. Doc Builder automatically:
- Generates navigation from your folder structure
- Extracts titles and summaries for tooltips
- Creates a searchable index
- Applies Notion-inspired styling

3. **Deploy to Production**
```bash
npx @knowcode/doc-builder@latest deploy
```

That's it! Your documentation is now live on Vercel with a public URL.

## Key Features That Make It Special

### üé® Beautiful by Default
I spent weeks perfecting the design so you don't have to. The Notion-inspired interface is clean, modern, and professional.

### üîç Search That Actually Works
Full-text search is built-in. No configuration needed. It just works.

### üåì Dark Mode
Automatic theme detection with manual toggle. Your readers' eyes will thank you.

### üìä Mermaid Diagrams
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Write Markdown] --> B[Run Deploy]
    B --> C[Live Documentation]
```

### üîê Password Protection
Need private docs? Enable authentication with one config line:
```javascript
features: {
  authentication: true
}
```

## The Technical Details

For the curious developers, here's what's under the hood:

- **Static Site Generation**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS for maximum performance
- **Zero Dependencies**: No runtime framework needed
- **SEO Optimized**: Meta tags, structured data, sitemap generation
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach
- **Incremental Builds**: Only rebuilds changed files

## Real-World Usage

I've been dogfooding Doc Builder for all my projects:
- API documentation with code examples
- Internal team wikis
- Open source project docs
- Personal knowledge base

The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Developers love the simplicity and designers love the aesthetics.

## What's Next?

I'm working on:
- GitHub Action for automated deployments
- More themes (though many users love the current one)
- Plugin system for extensions
- Internationalization support

## Try It Yourself

```bash
# Create a test project
mkdir my-docs && cd my-docs

# Initialize
npx @knowcode/doc-builder@latest init

# Start local server
npx @knowcode/doc-builder@latest dev

# Deploy when ready
npx @knowcode/doc-builder@latest deploy
```

## Conclusion

Doc Builder is my answer to documentation complexity. It's open source, MIT licensed, and available on npm today.

If you're tired of spending more time on documentation setup than actual writing, give it a try. I'd love to hear your feedback!
