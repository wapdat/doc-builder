# 🔐 Test Documentation with Supabase Auth

Welcome to the test documentation site! If you can see this page, it means:

## ✅ Authentication is Working!

- You successfully logged in with Supabase
- Your user account has access to this documentation site
- The JWT token is valid and verified
- Row Level Security is properly configured

## 🧪 Test Features

### Secure Access
This page is protected by enterprise-grade Supabase authentication. Only authorized users can view this content.

### Modern Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Generated static HTML with auth checking
- **Backend**: Supabase authentication and database
- **Security**: JWT tokens, bcrypt password hashing, RLS policies

### What This Proves
1. **Database Setup**: Tables were created correctly
2. **Authentication Flow**: Login → JWT → Access check → Content
3. **Integration**: doc-builder + Supabase working together
4. **Security**: Only authenticated users with proper access can see this

## 🎯 Next Steps

Once this test works, we can:
- Deploy to Vercel with production settings
- Add more users and documentation sites  
- Set up your real documentation content
- Configure custom domains and advanced features
